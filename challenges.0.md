## 0. Create Resources

In this challenge you will set up all it takes to complete this hackathon.
Here's a list of things we need to set up:

Creating resources on Azure:

- _Resource Group_ - this will be the place where we create all our Azure resources
- _Azure shell_ - this will be used to execute commands
- _Azure Container Registry_ - here we are going to store our Docker container images
