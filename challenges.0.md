## 0. Create Resources
In this challenge you will set up all it takes to complete this hackathon.
Here's a list of things we need to set up:

Creating resources on Azure:
- *Resource Group* - this will be the place where we create all our Azure resources 
- *Ubuntu VM for building and tagging* - we need a machine to work with Docker. If your local machine isn't set up for Docker, just start up an instance in Azure - use the Ubunut 16.04 LTS
- *Azure Container Registry* - here we are going to store our Docker container images
