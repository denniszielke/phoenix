# Use your Azure Pass

You can run this workhop either in your existing Azure subscription (recommended) or in a temporary subscription created with an Azure pass.
If you want to use an Azure pass ask your trainer to provide you a key. However you need a Microsoft account to get started. Here's [how to sign up for a Microsoft account](msaccount_setup.md).

To activate your pass go visit https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/ and hit the Start button. Then follow the instructions [here](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/Home/HowTo?Length=5).
